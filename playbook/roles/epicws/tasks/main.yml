# We need to tell the client what the server's DHCP-assigned IP
# address is. This is surprisingly difficult to do in Vagrant.
# Because I can't find a good way to do it, I'm making two roles: one
# for the server and one for the client(s). This is the server role
# which writes its ws_ip IP address to a file.

- name: set default value for ws_ip
  set_fact:
    ws_ip: "{{ ansible_host }}"
  when: ws_ip is not defined

- name: write IP address to file
  shell: "echo {{ ws_ip }} > ws_ip"

- name: fetch the ws_ip file back to the host
  fetch:
    src: ws_ip
    dest: ws_ip
    flat: yes
